# Warhammer Game Master Toolkit
# This application is a simple tool to help game masters during play, originally developed for my own use.
# 1. It helps setting up combat, by rolling for players and their enemies initiative. Player's statistics are stored in a file for continuous use.
# 2. It allows for hidden perception checks, without players even knowing it.
# 3. It implements a random name generator. After generating a name for NPC, a GM can add in some notes, and save the NPC. A file with NPCs is easy to access in any moment, and can be modified during campaign play.
